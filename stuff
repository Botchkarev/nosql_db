ACID and CAP 



two connections: neo4j (7474) and bolt (7687)
what is the difference between these two and why should i use them?


from neo4j doc (:help bolt in neo4j browser):
By default, Neo4j Browser communicates with the database via Bolt using the Neo4j JavaScript Driver. However it is possible to turn off Bolt and communicate with the database using HTTP(S) as in older versions of Neo4j Browser

() is a node
(variable:Table {properties to idenfity it}
CREATE (TheMatrix:Movie {title:'The Matrix', released:1999, tagline:'Welcome to the Real World'})

use cases:
relationships are more readable and easier to manage
more complicated relationships such as descendant, father_of, mother_of etc.
are bidirectional relationships possible?

besondere:
vergleich zu sql gelegentlich in bezug auf:
- syntax

- schema: 
  - relationships
  - datensätze
    - nodes vs. variables
- administrierung
  - kommunikation mit datenbank
  - zugriffskontrolle
- konsistenz
